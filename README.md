# Next Time

A modern Chrome extension built with [WXT](https://wxt.dev) that allows you to leave reminders on specific websites. When you visit a matched URL, it displays a clean alert to ensure you don't forget your task (e.g., checking out a shopping cart, verifying a setting).

## Features

- **Flexible URL Matching**: Set reminders for entire websites or specific pages.
- **Paginated Alerts**: Easily browse through multiple reminders on the same page with a clean navigation interface.
- **Works Everywhere**: Automatically detects when you navigate, ensuring reminders appear even on modern websites that don't fully reload.
- **Beautiful & Adaptive**: A polished design that integrates perfectly into any website and automatically matches your system's light or dark mode.
- **Draft Persistence**: Your notes are saved as you type, so you never lose them if the popup window closes accidentally.
- **Privacy Focused**: All data is stored locally in your browser. No external servers or tracking.
